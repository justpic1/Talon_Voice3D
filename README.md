Voice-3d is an in progress CAD program add-on that will integrate [Talon](https://talon.wiki/) into the 3d modeling workspace. I was heavily inspired by [Cursorless](https://www.cursorless.org/). The goal is to have the project working primarily with Fusion360 by March 2025. Followed by other CAD programs.
